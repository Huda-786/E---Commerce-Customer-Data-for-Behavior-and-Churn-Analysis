This project involves performing a data analysis life cycle, but mainly focuses on the ETL cycle for engineering. 
Our e-commerce customer dataset is a stimulative dataset. 
It was generated by the faker python library, which is a library that helps in generating artificial datasets. 
Our main goal for this project is to able to classify the churn of each customer accurately.
